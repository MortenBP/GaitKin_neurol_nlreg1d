# GaitKin_neurol_nlreg1d

This repository contains the code for generating a graphical representation of data for the study on gait pathology, kinematics and self-reported comfort in body weight supported gait of young adults with neurological disorders.

<br>
This repository contains code and example data associated with the paper:

Pedersen MB, Simonsen MB, Aagaard P, Rasmussen G, Stengaard A, Holsgaard-Larsen A (in review). Quality, kinematics, and self-reported comfort of gait during body weight support in young adults with gait impairments â€“ a cross-sectional study.

This repository is for use in Matlab. However, since the [nlreg1d](https://github.com/0todd0000/nlreg1d) repository is currently only available in python, the non-linear registration is performed by running a python environment and executing python code through Matlab.
The nlreg1d repository contains primarily wrapper functions to key functionality in [fdasrsf](https://github.com/jdtuck/fdasrsf_python) and [scikit-fda](https://fda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [spm1d](https://spm1d.org).
